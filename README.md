# dotfiles

## disclaimers

- Buyer beware
- These dotfiles are guaranteed to work only in Mac OS. They will probably also work in Linux but I have not tested them.

## installing

    $ git clone git@github.com:needcaffeine/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    $ cd ~/.dotfiles
    $ make

Running `make` will show you all available options. You may decide you don't want all the things this repo does.

## updating

You may periodically need to pull in my latest changes.

    $ cd ~/.dotfiles
    $ git pull
    $ make
